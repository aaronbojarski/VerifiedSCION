# VerifiedSCION

This is a repository forked from [SCION](https://github.com/scionproto/scion) at commit [cc378aaf5ac028995b3697d6ed9ad98d9a166227SCION](https://github.com/scionproto/scion/tree/cc378aaf5ac028995b3697d6ed9ad98d9a166227).

It is intended to be populated with Gobra annotation to the GO codebase to verify the SCION architecture.
The repository is intended to be updated regularly to the latest version of SCION.

Annotations will also be migrated from [this](https://github.com/jcp19/VerifiedSCION) repository in order to include the verification work conducted there.
